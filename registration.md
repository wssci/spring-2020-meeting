The Spring Meeting is offered in a hybrid form. Depending on developments of the COVID-19 pandemic by the time of the meeting, we encourage in-person participation to engage with our combustion community and actively participate at the technical sessions, reception, and other activities. For those not able to travel, we will make arrangments to attend all technical sessions and keynote lectures in a virtual form.
