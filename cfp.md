Submissions are solicited for the 2022 Spring Meeting of the Western States Section of The Combustion Institute. Instead of full papers, we are requesting the submission of extended abstracts. Extended abstracts should be a minimum of two pages (approximately 1000 words) and should include at least one significant figure.

Extended abstracts should be submitted to one of the following colloquium topics:

- Laminar Flames
- Turbulent Flames
- Fires and Fire Safety 
- Diagnostics
- Chemical Kinetics
- Biomass Combustion and Gasification
- Soot and Nanomaterials 
- Stationary Combustion Systems
- Sprays, Droplets, and Supercritical Combustion
- Environmental Aspects of Combustion
- Detonations, Explosions, and Supersonic Combustion
- Internal Combustion, Gas Turbines, and Rocket Engines
- Microcombustion and New Combustion Concepts
- Numerical Methods and Machine Learning Techniques Applied to Combustion

Instructions for formatting the extended abstract submissions are available at the [Submission site](./submission.html).

#### Presentation (in-person/virtual)

Following the notification of the acceptance of your extended abstract you're invited to present your paper at the hybrid meeting. For presenters that attend the meeting in virtual form, we request submission of a prerecorded video presentation. Your prerecorded presentation will be presented during the regular session; discussions of the prerecorded presentations will be entertained after each video presentation. Further details on the format of the prerecorded presentations and the submission will be provided with the notification of accepted abstracts.
