Extended abstracts should be submitted to one of the following colloquium topics:

- Laminar Flames
- Turbulent Flames
- Fires and Fire Safety 
- Diagnostics

- Biomass Combustion and Gasification
- Soot and Nanomaterials 
- Stationary Combustion Systems
- Sprays, Droplets, and Supercritical Combustion
