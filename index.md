The Western States Section of the Combustion Institute (WSSCI) is a non-profit educational and scientific society whose purpose is to promote the science and application of combustion for the benefit of the society. It was incorporated on December 10, 2014 in the State of Delaware, United States of America. The WSSCI is composed of all members of The Combustion Institute resident in the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and the Pacific territories of the United States, without obligation upon the part of any member so included. All activities of WSSCI are carried out in coordination with [The Combustion Institute](https://www.combustioninstitute.org/).

The hybrid format invites attendees from other Combustion Institute sections within the US and abroad. Therefore, we encourage participation from other sections and would be thrilled to welcome you at the 2022 WSSCI Spring Technical Meeting!
