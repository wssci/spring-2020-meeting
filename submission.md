#### Extended Abstract Submission Opens: 6 January 2020

Submit an extended abstract in PDF format. This is a slight change from the process for previous years, as there is no longer a full paper submission following the acceptance of a shorter abstract as in earlier meetings. 
Submissions should be at least two pages (approximately 1000 words), and can include figures, references, etc. 

Please submit your extended abstracgt through [The Combustion Institute website <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://ams.combustioninstitute.org/).

Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submitted extended abstracts must be written in English, must be at least two pages in length in 12-point font, must render without error using standard PDF viewing tools, must print on US-Letter-sized paper, and must include the author names and affiliations on the first page. The extended abstract will be made available to conference attendees.
